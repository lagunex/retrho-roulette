This is a small webapp that helps you build a workout routine. You choose five exercise (from a list or writing your own) and the app will randomly tell you how many reps you have to do for each. The whole routine will be between 40 and 60 minutes long.

The webapp is built using:

- AngularJS.
- Bootstrap.
- JQuery.
